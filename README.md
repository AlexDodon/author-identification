# author-identification

A crude implementation of the system described in Mohsen, A. M., El-Makky, N. M., & Ghanem, N. (2016). Author Identification Using Deep Learning. 2016 15th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA).

This repo implements a subset of the paper and I got an accuracy in the 84%-90% range with little training/parameter tweaking.

I used The Blog Authorship Corpus. J. Schler, M. Koppel, S. Argamon and J. Pennebaker (2006). Effects of Age and Gender on Blogging in Proceedings of 2006 AAAI Spring Symposium on Computational Approaches for Analyzing Weblogs.
